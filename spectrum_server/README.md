# Spectrum Server

**Spectrum Server** is a lightweight FastAPI application that provides a set of HTTP endpoints for interacting with a radio receiver.  
It offers functionality to:

* Retrieve the current UTC time.
* Wait for a configurable number of seconds.
* Tune the radio to a specific center frequency.
* Query recent measurement results stored in a MongoDB database.

The server is wrapped with **FastMCP**, exposing a Management Control Plane (MCP) for healthâ€‘checking and future extensions.
